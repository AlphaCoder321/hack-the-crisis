| Idea Title       | Description         | Source |    Area of Application | Technology Used |

| Pharma-Q | We implemented a service that monitors the line of customers formed at the entrance of shops/offices (e.g. pharmacies) from video streams acquired via CCTV surveillance cameras or from pictures taken by shops’ customers using ML techniques. A map of the pharmacies of Bolzano was created, in which the users can access the queue level. The goal is to raise customer awareness about the number of customers waiting in entrance queues, and hence allow the customers to take better decisions about where they should go shopping for their medical supplies. The prototype can be extended from pharmacies to other customer queuing stores like supermarkets and post offices | weagainstvirus Italy | Helping General Population  | Machine Learning: Computer Vision |
| Jetzt Liefern! | Web shop: Provide a system where local stores and restaurants can register as a merchant for presenting and selling their products online. Customers can see all the store details as well as their products and directly place an order. The stores can choose either to deliver the purchased items by themselves or by our partner OMEST – a local shipping company. The goal is to make it as simple as possible. So basically, we provide a list of products, where the customer can indicate the quantity for each one and submit the order. We are building this idea on top of our project jetztliefern.it, where already over 150 local stores which are delivering goods are registered. The feature can be used for free | weagainstvirus Italy | Helping General Population  | Custom-built Website |
| One Stop Solution for Distance Learning | The project aims at developing a network of educational, on-line support for children from primary schools. It operates on the basis of creating school tandems: a highschool willing to help gets paired with a primary school, whose students could profit from the cooperation. The students and graduates of the high school involved in the project take on the role of tutors for primary school children | weagainstvirus Italy | Helping School Students  | Custom-built Website |
| ML | Our goal is to diagnose COVID-19 reliably from X-Ray images using Artificial Intelligence. The current methods of choice are clinical tests or CT images. Both of these methods are expensive, time consuming or cause a high radiation exposure. In contrast x-rays are cheap, fast to make and widely available. Since x-ray data of COVID-19 patients is hard to get we use hundred-thousands of chest-x-rays in open datasets from other sources and teach the model everything there is to know about them before fine-tuning it to distinguish COVID-19, other causes of Pneumonia as well as healthy or other thoracical pathologies | weagainstvirus Italy | Helping Healthcare Workers  | Machine Learning: Medical Imaging |
