| Pharma-Q | We implemented a service that monitors the line of customers formed at the entrance of shops/offices (e.g. pharmacies) from video streams acquired via CCTV surveillance cameras or from pictures taken by shopsâ€™ customers using ML techniques. A map of the pharmacies of Bolzano was created, in which the users can access the queue level. The goal is to raise customer awareness about the number of customers waiting in entrance queues, and hence allow the customers to take better decisions about where they should go shopping for their medical supplies. The prototype can be extended from pharmacies to other customer queuing stores like supermarkets and post offices | weagainstvirus Italy | Helping General Population  | |
